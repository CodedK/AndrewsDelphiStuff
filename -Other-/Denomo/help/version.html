<h3>Change logs:</h3>
<br />

<h5>V 2.1.0. Released at Jun. 9, 2008. Major upgrade version.</h5>
<b>New:</b> Now support leak detection for C++ programs (BCB and VC). <br />
<br />

<b>New:</b> Enhanced bad pointer detection. Now free on freed pointer, calling freed object's virtual method, calling freed interface's method, can be detected. <br />
<br />

<b>Update:</b> Improve the code hook engine so that it won't disturb the stack trace any more. <br />
<br />

<b>Update:</b> Now there is an option that show warning whenever Denomo runs. Thanks to Sasa Zeman to suggest that. <br />
<br />

<b>Update:</b> Now there is an option that can limit the log file size, or overwrite the log file rather than appending to it. Thanks to Sasa Zeman to suggest that. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> Replace the buggy binary tree algorithm with the Arkadia one. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> A bug causes access violation exception when shut down if Denomo is used in a DLL. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> An "integer overflow" bug when "overflow checking" is enabled. <br />
<br />

<b>Remove:</b> DenomoSimpleMM.pas was removed. <br />

<br /><br />


<h5>V 2.0.0. Released at Feb. 5, 2008. Major upgrade version.</h5>
<b>New:</b> Now support GDI leak detection! And more resource leak detection will be added in the future version. <br />
<br />

<b>New:</b> Add support reporting to log file when check on exit. Thanks to <a href="http://www.szutils.net/">Sasa Zeman</a> to suggest that. <br />
<br />

<b>New:</b> Add a global .ini config to replace DenomoConfig.pas thus the user don't need to modify the code any more. Thanks to <a href="http://www.szutils.net/">Sasa Zeman</a> to suggest that. <br />
<br />

<b>New:</b> Add checking for Delphi or debugger running on startup to ensure Denomo is only used for debugging purpose. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> A random bug causing dead lock in multi-thread application. <br />

<br /><br />


<h5>V 1.0.3. Released at Dec. 8, 2007. Trivial upgrade version.</h5>
<b>New:</b> Now before reporting leaks, Denomo can remove all memory blocks which are allocated from the same calling path. This feature can significantly suppress the output information.<br />

<br /><br />


<h5>V 1.0.2. Released at Nov. 25, 2007. Bug fix version.</h5>
<b>New:</b> Add DenomoRuntime.dll to wrap all third party source code so you can use the binary directly to enjoy the powful JCLDebug without download JCL library. <br />
<br />

<b>New:</b> Add support "String" and "Dynamic array" memory type beside object. <br />
<br />

<b>New:</b> Add the unit DenomoConfig.pas to fully control Denomo's behavior. This makes Denomo less depending on Denomo.inc (the compiler directive version of the config). <br />
<br />

<b>New:</b> Add a "Save to file" button in LeakInspector to save the report content to a file. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> Remove the dependence on SysUtils and Classes, so now Denomo will not wrongly report memory leaks (allocated by unit Classes) when check on exit. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> Now report the actual size of a memory block rather than the rounded up one. <br />
<br />

<b>Update:</b> Significantly optimized the speed of outputing string to richedit in the Inspector. Now it's more than 50 to 100 times faster than older versions.<br />
Testing on a CeleronD 2.0G HZ 512M Ram, full source code informatio is outputed, reporting around 3000 blocks costs only no more than 2 seconds, 35000 blocks costs about 40 seconds, 70000 blocks costs about 120 seconds. <br />
Failed on testing on 100,000 blocks reporting due to the small RAM. LeakInspector eat up all of the physical memory and Windows was very busy on swapping memory out. <br />
But if the host machine has 1 or 2G memory, reporting 100K to 200K blocks is easy. <br />

<br /><br />


<h5>V 1.0.1. Released at Nov. 18, 2007. Bug fix version.</h5>
<b>Fix:</b> Crash in function NewGetMem with float point exception on Delphi 2006, 2007 or FastCode is used. Thanks Alan Garny to report that. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> Range Checking error in TSimpleStringBufferWriter.Write. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> A bug that wrongly output message to MessageBox. <br />
<br />

<b>Fix:</b> Suppress the compiling warning messages. Thanks Alan Garny to report that. <br />
<br />

<b>Update:</b> Remove all "int 3" instructions. Show a message box to prompt when need to break. Thanks Alan Garny to report that. <br />
<br />

<b>Update:</b> Make the help document more useful. Added some tutorials and rules. <br />

<br /><br />
